# üìò Fundamentals of Python

Welcome to my Python learning repository! Here you'll find simple and practical Python examples I solved during my learning phase.

## üêç About Python

Python is a beginner-friendly, high-level programming language created by Guido van Rossum in 1991. It‚Äôs open source, easy to read,  
and widely used in web development, automation, data analysis, machine learning, deep learning, NLP/AI, and data science.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How Python Displays Output

- **Compiler**: Converts `.py` file to bytecode (`.pyc`).
- **Interpreter (PVM)**: Converts bytecode to machine code and executes it line by line.
- **Output**: The result (like `print()` values) is shown in the terminal or console screen.
